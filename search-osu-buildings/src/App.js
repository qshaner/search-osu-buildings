Here is the Problem and Psuedocode:
Problem: User searches something and gets a result or results for what they search

Pseudocode:
First, you need the data
You need the search criteria from the user
The data needs to be stripped to only relevant information
        (address, name, description, departments and categories)
After you have search criteria from user, you need to find the data packages that
fit the criteria
Somehow, you need to get the matched data back to the user
*/

Ideally, you would have a search list and a filterable list with pictures and 
the names of the buildings

{//HERE is the problem! GetResults relies on the state, so therefore, FilterResults also relies on state
//When you press 'GO' the page is listening to anychange and rerenders the whole component, thus making 
//it so that the searchText is blank again. Given that filterResults should only be called on submit,
//You never actually filter the results -> Search function doesn't work
